# org-billing progress

Swimma's own billing moves from tenant to organization: two plans (Standard, Advanced), price per internal user, monthly or yearly commitment.

## Status

- [ ] Phase 0: preparation and plan. Waiting for OK.
- [ ] Phase 1: database (`20250101000014_org_billing.sql`)
- [ ] Phase 2: server
- [ ] Phase 3: UI
- [ ] Phase 4: cleanup and final checks

## Phase 0 findings

### Code that reads the old billing (all of it gets replaced)

- DB: `platform_plans`, `platform_subscriptions`, `organizations.max_tenants` (migrations 010, 012), triggers `members_enforce_plan_member_limit` (SW001/SW003) and `locations_enforce_plan_location_limit` (SW002/SW003) with their functions, `enforce_org_max_tenants` (SW004, reads `max_tenants`), views `platform_tenant_usage` and `platform_organization_usage`, functions `register_organization` (6 args with `p_trial_days`), `create_tenant_for_owner`, `create_tenant_row` (creates a per-tenant subscription).
- TS: `lib/data/platform-plan.ts` (retire; it also hard-codes DEFAULT_PLANS), `lib/actions/superadmin.ts` (`updateTenantSubscription`, `updateOrganizationLimit`), `lib/validations/superadmin.ts`, `lib/data/organization.ts` (`max_tenants`), `lib/actions/owner.ts` (`TRIAL_DAYS`), `lib/config.ts` (`TRIAL_DAYS`), `app/api/onboarding/register/route.ts`, `scripts/seed-admin.ts`, `lib/actions/types.ts` (`PLAN_LIMIT_CODES` has SW001/SW002), `lib/actions/{members,settings}.ts` (use `PLAN_LIMIT_CODES`).
- UI: `components/pricing/plan-cards.tsx`, `components/admin/plan-status-banner.tsx`, `app/page.tsx` (pricing section, "14 hari" copy), `app/daftar/page.tsx` and `components/shared/register-club-form.tsx`, `app/admin/page.tsx` (banner), `app/admin/klub/page.tsx` (limit text), `app/superadmin/(portal)/page.tsx`, `components/superadmin/{subscription-form,organization-controls}.tsx`.

### Plan

**Migration `20250101000014_org_billing.sql`** (one file; follow-ups would be 015+)
- `subscription_plans`, `organization_subscriptions`, `platform_modules` as in the task, with RLS: plans (active) and modules readable by anon and authenticated; `organization_subscriptions` readable only by admin profiles of that organization; every write is service role only. Seeds exactly as decided (standard 150000 / limit 3 / 30 days, advanced 250000 / unlimited / 0 days, 0.5 free months; modules ready/soon).
- `platform_quote(p_plan, p_period, p_users)` returns `users` (min 1), `unit_price`, `months` (1 or 12 − free months), `total`, `per_month` (total ÷ 1 or ÷ 12). Execute revoked from public/anon/authenticated, granted to `service_role`.
- `organization_internal_users(org)` (server-only): active `org_owners` + active profiles with `owner_id is null` and role admin/coach in any tenant of the organization. The owner's per-club admin profiles are not counted.
- Triggers: drop SW001/SW002 triggers and functions. One gate function raises `SW003` on: new/reactivated member, new club, new/reactivated internal user (non-owner admin/coach profile, new/reactivated owner), when the subscription is `pending`, `suspended`, `cancelled`, or `trial` past `trial_ends_at` (Asia/Jakarta). `SW004` on club insert: effective limit = `coalesce(club_limit_override, plan.club_limit)`; the trigger locks the subscription row `for update`. A before-update trigger on `organization_subscriptions` rejects a plan or override change that leaves the organization over the effective limit (so Advanced → Standard with 4 clubs fails, for owner and superadmin alike).
- `register_organization(org name, club name, owner name, email, hash, plan, period)`: org → subscription (Standard: `trial` for `trial_days`; Advanced: `pending`) → owner → club → owner admin profile. `create_tenant_for_owner(owner, name)` no longer creates a subscription. Old signatures dropped, new ones revoked from public/anon/authenticated and granted to `service_role`.
- `set_organization_status(org, status, actor, period_start, period_end)` (service role only): updates the subscription and flips `tenants.is_active` for every tenant of the organization (`pending`, `trial`, `active` → active; `suspended`, `cancelled` → inactive); sets `activated_at/by` on activation.
- `platform_organization_usage` is recreated: organization, plan, period, status, trial end, period end, effective club limit, clubs, members, internal users, total for the period, per month. Still service role only.
- `platform_plans`, `platform_subscriptions`, `organizations.max_tenants` stay in the schema, unused.

**Backfill (per organization)**
- Plan: `advanced` if any of its tenants had an old plan with no member limit and no location limit, otherwise `standard`.
- Period: `monthly`.
- Status: highest of its tenants' old statuses, ranked `active` > `trial` > `suspended` > `cancelled`.
- `trial_ends_at`: latest old trial date among its tenants; if the status is `trial` and no date exists, today (WIB) + the plan's `trial_days`.
- `current_period_start/end`: left null (no payment history to derive them from). The portal shows "Belum diatur".
- `club_limit_override`: old `max_tenants` when it differs from the plan limit, with the exception below.
- Organizations whose tenants have no old subscription row: `advanced`, `active`, note "Dimigrasi tanpa langganan lama", so they stay unlimited as today.
- Tenants stay as they are; only `set_organization_status` changes `is_active` afterwards.

**Server**
- `lib/pricing.ts` (pure formula, client-safe, takes plan rows from the table) and `lib/data/platform-pricing.ts` (plans, modules, subscription, internal-user count, server quote through `platform_quote`). `platform-plan.ts` is deleted and has no fallback prices.
- Owner actions: `changePlan` (plan, period; the DB trigger enforces the downgrade rule; status unchanged, no proration), `previewInternalUserCost` (server computes the monthly price change) used before `createCoach`.
- Superadmin actions: activate (with period dates, defaulting to +1 month or +1 year), suspend, cancel, extend trial, edit plan (price, club limit, trial days, yearly free months), set club-limit override.
- Registration takes plan and period, recomputes the quote on the server, never reads a price from the client.

**UI (Phase 3)**: invoke `ui-ux-pro-max` first, then reuse the existing `Button`/`Select`/`Input`/`Table`/`Card`/`Dialog` and the existing button-pair toggle pattern; no new visual style.

### Decisions I need from you (defaults apply if you just say OK)

1. **First club bypasses SW003.** Without it an Advanced organization (`pending`) could not even create its first club at registration. Rule: the gate does not apply while the organization has no club yet (also covers its first owner). Everything after that is blocked as decided.
2. **Advanced is read-only until paid.** Because Advanced starts `pending`, its owner can sign in and open the billing page but cannot add members, coaches or clubs until the superadmin activates it. This follows decision 6; flagging the consequence.
3. **`club_limit_override` on backfill, exception for Advanced.** Taken literally, every Advanced organization would get an override of 3 (old default `max_tenants`) and be capped at 3 clubs. Default: no override when the plan is Advanced (unlimited). Say "literal" to copy `max_tenants` regardless.
4. **Organizations with no old subscription row** become `advanced` + `active`, to preserve today's unlimited behavior. Production Supabase is empty, so this only matters for other databases.
5. **Suspended and cancelled also trigger SW003** (not only pending and expired trial), so a stale session cannot add anything to a suspended organization.
6. **Landing prices need the migration.** Prices live only in the table, so the landing pricing section is empty until 014 is applied (current production Supabase is empty and unmigrated). No hard-coded fallback.
7. **Client estimate vs server quote.** The live total on the landing and wizard uses the same formula in TypeScript on the plan rows read from the table; every authoritative figure (registration, plan change, price-change confirmation, superadmin) comes from `platform_quote`. I will test that both agree.
8. **No staff-admin creation exists today** (only coaches). The confirmation helper is generic and wired to coach creation; the DB gate already covers staff admins. I will not build a staff-admin form unless you ask.
9. **Branch:** the session assigns `claude/swimma-org-tenants-bk1kpc`, your task says `main` only. Following your task: everything goes to `main`.
