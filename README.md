# Swimma

Multi-tenant swimming club management platform: membership, scheduling,
attendance, billing, cash ledger, coach payroll, and promo announcements, for
admin/coach/parent roles. One deployment can serve many independent clubs
(tenants), each with its own isolated data and branding.

Stack: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, Supabase Postgres with Row Level
Security, Tailwind CSS, Vercel deployment.

## Multi-tenancy model

Every club is a row in `tenants`. All club-owned data (profiles, locations,
class types, children, classes, bookings, packages, subscriptions, invoices,
cash ledger, payroll, promo) carries a `tenant_id` and is isolated by
Postgres Row Level Security — the database, not the frontend, is the
isolation boundary. `current_tenant_id()` reads the tenant id embedded in the
caller's session JWT, and every RLS policy filters by it; cross-tenant
foreign key references (e.g. a booking's child and class must belong to the
same tenant) are additionally rejected by trigger checks at write time.

A profile (login identity) belongs to exactly one tenant with one role
(admin/coach/parent). The same email address can hold separate accounts in
different clubs. A club's own name, logo, and primary color live in
`tenants` and are edited from Admin -> Pengaturan; they are not environment
variables.

## Auth model

Authentication is **custom** (bcrypt password hashes in our own
`auth_credentials` table), not Supabase Auth. On login (email + password +
club code), the server verifies the password and mints its own JWT signed
with the Supabase project's JWT secret, carrying `sub` (profile id),
`tenant_id`, and `app_role` (admin/coach/parent). That JWT is stored in an
httpOnly cookie and attached as the `Authorization` header on every Supabase
request, so Postgres RLS (`auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()`) enforces both role and
tenant scoping exactly as it would with Supabase Auth.

**Before running migrations against a real project**, check Project
Settings → API → JWT Keys. This setup requires the legacy shared **HS256
JWT secret** to be available (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`). If a project only has
asymmetric JWT signing keys enabled and no legacy secret, self-minted HS256
tokens won't validate against PostgREST — in that case use Supabase's
Third-Party Auth (JWKS) support instead of `lib/auth/jwt.ts` as written.

The service-role key is used only in a few narrow, reviewed places (never in
client-reachable code): login lookup, creating a parent/coach account
together with its credentials row, the monthly invoice-generation cron and
its "generate now" admin button. Every other read/write goes through the
per-request JWT-bound client, so RLS is the real security boundary. Every
service-role write to a tenant-scoped table passes `tenant_id` explicitly
(the service-role client has no session JWT for `current_tenant_id()` to
read).

Deactivating an account (`profiles.is_active = false`) cuts off all DB
access immediately, even though its JWT technically hasn't expired — this is
enforced inside the `is_admin()` / `is_coach()` / `is_parent()` SQL helper
functions, not just in individual policies.

## Local setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Enable extensions `pgcrypto`, `btree_gist`, `pg_trgm` (the first migration
   does this automatically if the project allows it).
3. Apply the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in order (via the
   Supabase CLI, `supabase db push`, or pasting them into the SQL editor in
   order).
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Project
     Settings → API.
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Project Settings → API (server-only,
     never expose to the client).
   - `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` — Project Settings → API → JWT Keys (legacy
     secret; see the note above).
   - `CRON_SECRET` — any random string; Vercel Cron sends it automatically
     as a bearer token once set as an env var on the project.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` — optional; the platform name shown before a
     club is selected (login screen, browser tab). Defaults to "Swimma".
5. Onboard the first club and its admin account:
   ```bash
   SEED_TENANT_SLUG=my-club SEED_TENANT_NAME="My Club" \
   SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123 \
   npm run seed:admin
   ```
   Run it again with a different `SEED_TENANT_SLUG` to onboard another club
   onto the same deployment/database.
6. `npm run dev` and log in at `/login` with the club code, email, and
   password.

## Deploying to Vercel

Create a Vercel project linked to this repo, set the same environment
variables there, and deploy. `vercel.json` already schedules the monthly
invoice-generation cron (`/api/cron/generate-invoices`, 1st of each month),
which generates invoices for every active tenant in one run.

## Onboarding a new club

Because isolation is enforced at the database level (RLS + `tenant_id`),
new clubs are onboarded onto the **same** deployment and Supabase project —
no new Supabase project or Vercel deployment needed. Two ways in:

- **Self-service** (`/daftar`): a club owner enters club name, club code,
  and their own name/email/password and lands in `/admin` already logged
  in. The club starts on the **Trial** plan (14 days, 20 active children,
  1 location). If the Trial plan is missing or any step fails, nothing is
  left behind (tenant/profile/credentials are rolled back).
- **Manual** (`npm run seed:admin` with a new `SEED_TENANT_SLUG`/
  `SEED_TENANT_NAME`). Clubs created this way have no platform
  subscription row and are therefore **not** limited until a superadmin
  assigns them a plan.

The new admin then sets their own club name/logo/color from Admin ->
Pengaturan.

## Platform billing (superadmin)

Swimma bills clubs separately from how a club bills its parents. A
superadmin is not tied to any tenant and manages every club's plan and
status from `/superadmin`.

- Bootstrap the first superadmin from the CLI (there is deliberately no UI
  for this):
  ```bash
  SEED_SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com SEED_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD='a-long-password' \
  npm run seed:superadmin
  ```
- `/superadmin/login` uses its own `superadmin_session` cookie. The JWT
  carries `{ sub, superadmin: true, email, full_name }` with audience
  `swimma-superadmin`, is never sent to Supabase as a bearer token, and a
  tenant session JWT is rejected there. Every portal query uses the
  service-role client; `superadmins`, `platform_tenant_usage`, and writes to
  `platform_subscriptions` are unreachable from `anon`/`authenticated`.
- Plans live in `platform_plans` (`member_limit`, `location_limit`; `null`
  means unlimited). Limits are enforced by triggers on `children`
  (insert and re-activation) and `locations`, error codes `SW001`/`SW002`.
  A tenant without a `platform_subscriptions` row is not limited.
- Status **suspended** or **cancelled** sets `tenants.is_active = false`:
  new logins are refused and live sessions lose access immediately
  (`is_active_user()` checks the tenant too). No data is deleted; switching
  back to **trial** or **active** restores access to everything.
- Club admins can read the plan menu and their own subscription (dashboard
  banner during trial) but cannot change either, and can only update
  `name`, `logo_url`, `primary_color` on `tenants`.
- There is no payment gateway: a superadmin sets a club to **active** after
  being paid outside the app. Trial expiry is shown on `/superadmin` but not
  enforced automatically.

### Pricing model

Prices are derived from the fixed monthly infrastructure floor, because one
deployment serves every tenant:

- Vercel Pro ≈ $24/mo, Supabase Pro ≈ $25/mo, plus a usage buffer ≈ $20–30
  → **≈ Rp 1.300.000/bulan** at ≈ Rp 17.900/USD. Verify current prices and
  FX before relying on this.
- Marginal cost per extra tenant ≈ Rp 0 until usage pushes Supabase/Vercel
  into a higher tier.
- Starter Rp 300.000 (75 members, 1 location), Growth Rp 750.000 (250
  members, 3 locations), Pro Rp 1.500.000 (unlimited). Break-even ≈ 5
  Starter, 2 Growth, or 1 Pro club.
- The landing page and dashboard read prices from `platform_plans`, so
  editing a plan there updates what clubs see.

## Notes / out of scope

- Swim competition (lomba renang) tracking is intentionally not built, but
  nothing in the schema (e.g. `class_types`) assumes it can't be added
  later.
- WhatsApp and payment-gateway integrations are left as TODOs — invoices are
  marked paid manually by an admin for now.
- No self-registration: admin creates parent and coach accounts (with a
  temporary password that must be changed on first login) since letting
  parents register themselves would undermine the duplicate-child check.

## Changelog

### 2026-09-26

- Platform billing: `superadmins`, `platform_plans`, `platform_subscriptions`,
  `platform_tenant_usage` (migration `20250101000010_platform_billing.sql`),
  `/superadmin` portal, `npm run seed:superadmin`.
- Plan member and location limits enforced in the database.
- Suspended/cancelled clubs lose access immediately, including live
  sessions; `tenants` is now column-restricted for club admins.
- Self-service club signup at `/daftar` with a 14-day trial.
- Landing page pricing section and admin trial banner, both reading
  `platform_plans`.
- Deactivated/suspended sessions are cleared through
  `/api/auth/session-ended` (cookies can't be deleted during Server
  Component render).

### 2026-09-22

- Added `frontend-design`, `bencium-innovative-ux-designer`, `design-audit`
  skills under `.claude/skills/`.
- Admin dashboard (`/admin`) now shows live KPIs, overdue/expiring alerts,
  today's classes, recent cash entries, and quick actions (was a static
  welcome card).
- Search/filter added to the members, coaches, schedule, subscriptions, and
  invoices list pages.
- New session-pack billing mode (N sessions / X weeks) alongside the
  existing recurring `billing_cycle` packages — additive migration
  `20250101000009_session_packages.sql`, a `subscription_usage` view, and a
  fix to `generate_invoices_for_period` so it never double-bills
  session-pack subscribers.
- Light/dark theme (`next-themes`).
- Add/manage flows switched from dedicated pages and always-visible inline
  forms to dialogs (native `<dialog>`, Next.js intercepting routes for
  members/coaches/schedule).
- Public marketing landing page at `/` (hero, features, how-it-works,
  multi-tenant section, dashboard preview, CTA, footer); an authenticated
  session still redirects straight to its role home, and `/login` is
  unchanged.
